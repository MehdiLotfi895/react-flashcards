# React Flashcards App 📝

A simple and interactive React application designed to help users learn core React concepts through flip-cards.

## 🚀 Features
* **Interactive UI:** Click on a card to flip between the question and the answer.
* **State Management:** Uses the `useState` hook to track which card is currently selected.
* **Dynamic Rendering:** Maps through a list of educational content to generate cards dynamically.
* **Toggle Logic:** Clicking a card reveals the answer, and clicking it again (or clicking another) resets the view.
* **Custom Styling:** Features a clean layout with dedicated CSS for card dimensions, colors, and alignment.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
The app includes flashcards for the following essential concepts:
* **JavaScript:** The base language React is built on.
* **Components:** The fundamental building blocks of React apps.
* **JSX:** The syntax used to describe UI in React.
* **Props:** Passing data from parent to child components.
* **useState:** Giving components memory and managing state.
* **Controlled Elements:** Synchronizing input elements with state.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **React.js:** Core library used for the UI and logic.
* **CSS3:** For layout (Flexbox) and card design.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for data structures and logic handling.

## 💻 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/MehdiLotfi895/react-flashcards.git](https://github.com/MehdiLotfi895/react-flashcards.git)
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
